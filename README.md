# NOAA_PBLH
The planetary boundary layer heigth (PBLH) is an important component of the modeling of pollutant transport and weather prediction algoritms. Accurate values are imperative to successfully predict pollutant levels, such as particulate matter PM, an allert the population on time of any harmful levels. This project will focus on getting the most accurate PBLH using LiDAR data. The carrier to noise (CNR) values from the lidar are being used for the calculations.
